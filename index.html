<p style="font-size:160%;"> My Hero Academia (Boku No Hero Academia) is an animated TV show, created in Japan. It is set in a world where the vast majority of people are born with abilities (called Quirks in the show) and being superpowered is considered the norm. The show follows a young bot named Izuku Midoriya as he strives to be the world’s #1 hero, despite being born quirkless. However, his luck soon changes when he meets All Might, the actual #1 hero, who reveals that he himself was born without a quirk until his mentor passed down the ability known as “One For All” which is the secret to how he became so powerful to him. The Quirk cultivates the power of its users and allows them to possess abilities so immense that All Might himself made it rain with a single punch, and he has chosen young Midoriya to be his successor </p>
