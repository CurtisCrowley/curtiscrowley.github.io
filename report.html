<p>Interact-ability</p>
<br>
<p>In terms of interact-ability, my website allows the user to design their own costume using the canvas features of JavaScript. This gives the user some control and say in how they use the site and offers responsive feedback. I also gave the user the option to choose either a male or a female model to use in the canvas. Furthermore, I created an interactable gallery of images. It was 20 characters from the show and you soulcd scroll through the images by clicking on them, each new image had a snippet of text explaining breifly what the character could do. I figured this was better than having a cluttered page. This way you would onl see one character at a time and not be overwhelmed.   </p>

<p>As shown, the gallery required me to make a couple of arrays to hold the data of the pictures of each character as well as the text. It was this reason I chose to use arrays.</p>
<br>
<p>For mobile users, i made sure that the website would still be accessible on mobile. </p>

<p>As well as being accessible to mobile users, the interoperbility of my site allows for it to be used on multiple browsers such as chrome, firefox  </p>
